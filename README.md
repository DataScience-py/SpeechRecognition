# Speech Recognition System
## Description
This project is focused on speech recognition using modern machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The primary goal is to provide an accurate and efficient system that converts speech data into text.

It is useful for applications requiring voice input, such as voice assistants, automated response systems, and other related use cases.

## Technologies
(This section will be updated as the project develops.)
- Python
- pytorch/tensorflow

## Features
- Speech recognition from various sources (microphone, audio files) (add soon)
- Multi-language support (add soon)
- Noise reduction implementation for improved recognition quality (add soon)
- Create yourself model (add soon)
- Add more features (add soon)
